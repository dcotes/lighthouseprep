			<h1>There is no substitute for the art of <em><strong>HARVESTING THE CARAMEL</strong></em></h1>
			<h3>This is literally the best pasta dish you will ever eat...I promise</h3>
			<h3>It will make 10+ serivings</h3>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
			<ul id="list">
				<li>1/3 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
				<li>1/4 cup finely diced pancetta</li>
				<li>600 grams fatty pork</li>
				<li>670 grams ground beef</li>
				<li>1/4 heaping cup dried porcini mushrooms</li>
				<li>7 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
				<li>10 springs fresh thyme</li>
				<li>1 Tbsp minced rosemary leaves</li>
				<li>1 tsp chili flakes</li>
				<li>2 medium stalks of celery</li>
				<li>1 large white onion</li>
				<li>1 small carrot</li>
				<li>4 dried bay leaves (or 2 fresh ones)</li>
				<li>4 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
				<li>1 2'' by 2'' piece of Parmigiano rind (yum)</li>
				<li>1875ml Whole Milk, divided into 5 375ml parts</li>
				<li>1600 grams <em>good quality</em> peeled tomatoes</li>
				<li>coarse sea salt/pepper, you know... the usual</li>
				<li>To Finish: <ul>
									<li>Any type fresh thick cut pasta (e.g. Tagliatelle). I reccomend making your own pasta.</li>

								</ul></li>
			</ul>

			<p><em>Notes:</em> Use a wide, flat, stick (not non-stick) pan to do this. It is IMPORTANT to choose the right pot for this dish.  You want something that is flat-bottomed, and wide (NOT narrow) with enough depth (but NOT deep).  The wide and flat-bottom provides enough surface area for browning, and the relatively shallow depth allow steam to escape without building up on the side of the pot, which is going to drip back into the pot and stop the ingredients from browning properly.


			It is also IMPORTANT to season along every step of the way.  Season the meats while they are cooking, then season AGAIN once the vegetables are added.  Then adjust/season AGAIN once the milk and tomatoes are added.  Every time you add LIQUID to a pot of stew of some sort, always keep in mind that it will COOK DOWN/CONDENSE as water evaporates, so whatever tastes salty now, will tastes saltier once it is done.


			I did not use wine (white or red) in this recipe as some traditional ragu might have.  If you want, you can incorporate 1/2 cup of red wine in the beginning of step 2.

			** The cups I used for this recipe are slightly larger than most.  1 cup = 250 ml.</p>

			<h3>To Prepare the ingredients:</h3>
			<p>Finely finely mince the celery, onion carrots (smaller than dices), 
			then set aside.  I prefer doing this in a food-processor.  
			Wash the dried porcini mushrooms to get rid of any sands and impurity, 
			then set aside (no need to soak).  Blend all the canned tomatoes with 
			the juice inside until smoothly pureed, and set aside.</p>

			<h2><strong>Steps for success</strong></h2>
			<ol>
				<li><h3>Browning the meat and vegetables (approx 30 min in total)</h3>
						<p>  Heat up the pan over medium-high heat and add 1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil.  Add the pancetta and cook until slightly browned, then add the ground pork and ground beef.  Season with 1 tsp of sea salt/grey salt and 1 tsp of freshly ground black pepper.  This is quite a large amount of meat and they WILL NOT brown immediately.  Juice/liquid may ooze out but THAT IS OK, just keep cooking until all the liquid has evaporated, and that there is a layer of browning at the bottom of the pan, approx 15 min.

						Now add the porcini mushrooms. minced garlic, fresh thyme, minced rosemary and chili flakes.  Cook until fragrant.  Add all the minced vegetables (celery, onion, carrot), bay leaves, tomato paste and Parmigiano rind, and season again with 1 tsp of sea salt/grey salt and 1/2 tsp of freshly ground black pepper.  The vegetables will release juice/liquid which is going to loosen the browning on the bottom of the pan.  Scrape the brownings with a wooden spatula, then just as what was done before, keep cooking until all the juice/liquid has evaporated and that there is A BRAND NEW layer of browning forming at the bottom of the pan, approx 15 min.

				</li>
				<li><h3>Reducing the milk and <em>harvesting the caramel</em>:approx (1:40-2:00 hours total)</h3>
						<p>Once all the meats and vegetables have browned properly, add 1 1/2 cup of whole milk (if using red wine, add and reduce it down completely BEFORE adding the milk).  Keep the heat on medium-high, and stir to evenly mix all the ingredients together.  The milk will loosen the brownings and you will scrape it off with your wooden spatula to let it melt and become part of the sauce, then let it cook and the milk will completely evaporate and form ANOTHER NEW LAYER of brownings, approx 20 min.  You see the repetition now?  Then you add the next 1 1/2 cup of whole milk and repeat this process.  If your stove tends to heat unevenly, move around the pan to maximize the brownings.  Do not be afraid to let it get deeply rich and dark brown, as long as it DOES NOT BURN/BLACKEN (moving the pan also prevents partial burning due to centralized heat).  You will harvest the caramel (the brownings!) in each of the 5 additions of milk, and by the end of it, you should have a pot of meat sauce that is rich and brown with intense flavor.

				</li>
				<li><h3>Adding and reducing the tomatoes (approx: 1:30 hour)</h3>
						<p>Once the last/5th addition of whole milk has been added, reduced and browned, you can now add all the pureed tomatoes.  Season again with sea salt/grey salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Stir to evenly mix the ingredients and scrape the brownings on the bottom of the pan.  Reduce the heat down to medium-low and partially cover the pan with a lid (tomato sauce SPLATTERS like crazy!).  Let the sauce reduce down by 1/3 to almost 1/2.  Stir occasionally to prevent burning.

				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2><strong>To serve</strong></h2>
						<p> Cook the pasta (I prefer fresh tagliatelle) according to instructions.  In another pan, add a couple tbsp of freshly grated Parmigiano cheese (for each serving) and little nubs of butter (about 1 tsp for each serving).  Add the cooked pasta to the pan with a generous amount of ragu.  Cook and stir over medium-high heat until everything is incorporated together.

						Serve with more freshly grated Parmigiano cheese and drizzles of extra virgin olive oil.
